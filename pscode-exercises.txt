// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum


print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
1 and 2

add the 2 number together 
1 + 2 = 3

print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers
 print sum of (1 + 2)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

ask for 1 number
2

divide the number by 2
2/2 = 0

if the remainder is equal to 0 then number is even

if the remainder is not equal to 0 then number is odd



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

ask for 5 separate numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

add the 5 separate numbers together to get the sum then divide the sum by 5
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 3 

organize the 5 separate numbers in order from smallest number to the largest number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
smallest = 1
largest = 5

results from step b = 3
results from step c = 1 (smallest) and 5 (largest)
